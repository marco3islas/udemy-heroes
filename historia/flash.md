# The Flash
Three men have held the title of "The Fastest Man Alive"â€”Jay Garrick, Barry Allen and Wally West. Each of them redefined the word "hero."

The mysterious power known as the Speed Force is an energy field that has, over the centuries, granted incredible powers of velocity to certain heroes. The most famous of these is the Flash, also known as the Fastest Man Alive. Ever since the days of World War II, there has been a man clad in red who can run at impossible speeds, using his power to save lives and defend those who cannot defend themselves. All between the ticks of a second.
